# Production configuration
# DO NOT use VITE_API_TOKEN in production - use Twitch OAuth instead
# The application will use Twitch OAuth for authentication

# Discovery service URL (central service to map user_id -> tunnel_url)
# This service maintains the mapping between Twitch user_id and the local server tunnel URL
# The discovery service also returns the Twitch client_id of the local server
VITE_DISCOVERY_SERVICE=https://discovery.myhomegames.com

# API base URL (optional, will be dynamically replaced by tunnel_url obtained from discovery service)
# Can be removed or left empty if using only the discovery service
# The application will obtain the local server URL dynamically after Twitch login
